## Abstracts

**[Tame your Microservices with Helm and Software Release Trains]**: The deployment of apps in Kubernetes is simplified with the usage of Helm, but when it comes to deploying microservice architecture things can go a bit more wild as we have to manage multiple applications on potentially multiple environments. We'll discuss the different patterns for storing the charts on Git, either as mono or multi repos. We'll go through the ways to simplify and keep DRY our charts, and lastly we'll go review the different deployment patterns with Helm, either together as software release trains, or individually as with CI/CD.

**[Enfoque holístico de DevOps - Todo está conectado!]**: La transición hacia una solución de microservicios con un modelo DevOps tiene muchos peligros! Y si no fuera suficiente también tenemos que dar soporte a producción mientras. En esta charla hablaremos sobre un enfoque de vista pájaro como podemos hacer esta transición sin perdernos en el camino.

**[Kubernetes in Startups vs Enterprise: Using Custom Resources to extend workflow]**: Kubernetes and Containers are taking over the world and it seems that is they fit in every use-case from a small startup to big bank industries. But in reality every environment is unique with it´s own peculiarities. Kubernetes is not the end-game, it´s the platform for platforms. During this talk we´ll discuss about the differences between startups and enterprises and how we can fill the gap integrating inside Kubernetes our custom workflow using Custom Resources and Operators.

We´ll do a demo of a Project entity that helps provision namespaces and grants user access to team members. CRDs are a powerful tool for Kubernetes extensibility but with great power comes great responsibility.

**[Zero Downtimes with Faulty Solutions - Health Checks for Microservices to the Rescue](https://speakerdeck.com/spiddy/zero-downtimes-with-faulty-solutions)**: In this presentation we'll discuss what is a health check, why are they crucial when handling multiple docker containers of a service and how to use them with the new Docker Engine v1.13 using Docker Swarm. We'll use as an example a faulty solution with and without health checks and see the benefits they provide.

**[Netflix OSS and Kubernetes - Building a Microservice based Cloud platform]**: There is a need these days to break monolithic solutions to distributed microservices. This need arise along with the need to restructure organizations from separate silos to DevOps. Here we'll talk how to enable such migration using Spring Cloud, Spring Boot, Netflix OSS & Kubernetes and create a Cloud Platflorm where Microservices can be deployed easily using Docker containers. We'll discuss about the benefits of using NetflixOSS Eureka as Service Discovery, either on-premise or on-cloud environments and how zero downtime deployments can be easily achieved using rolling updates of Kubernetes. Lastly we'll focus on resiliency using health checks, auto healing, auto scaling and multiple data-centers on cloud providers.

**[Docker in Production or how to serve 23M daily requests]**: A fast-forward of the process to modernize an infrastructure to a Micro-service oriented and Container-based cluster.

**[The Quest for the Holy Grail of Continuous Delivery]**: So you started with the MEAN stack your development, but how do you deploy to production and tackle the challenges of continuously deliver your application? In this talk we'll explain how DEV and PRO are different in terms of needs and we'll use docker as a container engine to build an immutable environment for our MEAN app. We'll see how to use continuous delivery pipeline to separate build, test and deploy phases. We'll talk about how to achieve the holy grail of continuous delivery: one-click deploys with zero downtime. But still we need to prepare ourselves for the worst, when disaster come we need to have verified backups to restore the system in seconds.

**[Docker Workshop]**: The workshop is an entry-level workshop where you will learn the basics for building and running containers.

**[Introduction to Docker]**: This is an entry-level presentation about what is Docker and the basic concepts around container technology.

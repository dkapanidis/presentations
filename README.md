## Abstracts

**[Zero Downtimes with Faulty Solutions - Health Checks for Microservices to the Rescue](https://speakerdeck.com/spiddy/zero-downtimes-with-faulty-solutions)**: In this presentation we'll discuss what is a health check, why are they crucial when handling multiple docker containers of a service and how to use them with the new Docker Engine v1.13 using Docker Swarm. We'll use as an example a faulty solution with and without health checks and see the benefits they provide.

**[Netflix OSS and Kubernetes - Building a Microservice based Cloud platform](https://speakerdeck.com/spiddy/netflix-oss-and-kubernetes-building-a-microservice-based-cloud-platform)**: There is a need these days to break monolithic solutions to distributed microservices. This need arise along with the need to restructure organizations from separate silos to DevOps. Here we'll talk how to enable such migration using Spring Cloud, Spring Boot, Netflix OSS & Kubernetes and create a Cloud Platflorm where Microservices can be deployed easily using Docker containers. We'll discuss about the benefits of using NetflixOSS Eureka as Service Discovery, either on-premise or on-cloud environments and how zero downtime deployments can be easily achieved using rolling updates of Kubernetes. Lastly we'll focus on resiliency using health checks, auto healing, auto scaling and multiple data-centers on cloud providers.

**[Docker in Production or how to serve 23M daily requests](https://speakerdeck.com/spiddy/docker-in-production)**: A fast-forward of the process to modernize an infrastructure to a Micro-service oriented and Container-based cluster.

**[The Quest for the Holy Grail of Continuous Delivery](https://speakerdeck.com/spiddy/the-quest-for-the-holy-grail-of-continuous-delivery)**: So you started with the MEAN stack your development, but how do you deploy to production and tackle the challenges of continuously deliver your application? In this talk we'll explain how DEV and PRO are different in terms of needs and we'll use docker as a container engine to build an immutable environment for our MEAN app. We'll see how to use continuous delivery pipeline to separate build, test and deploy phases. We'll talk about how to achieve the holy grail of continuous delivery: one-click deploys with zero downtime. But still we need to prepare ourselves for the worst, when disaster come we need to have verified backups to restore the system in seconds.

**[Docker Workshop](https://github.com/harbur/docker-workshop)**: The workshop is an entry-level workshop where you will learn the basics for building and running containers.

**[Introduction to Docker](http://www.slideshare.net/spiddy/docker-intro-32958279)**: This is an entry-level presentation about what is Docker and the basic concepts around container technology.

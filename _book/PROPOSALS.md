* **Zero Downtimes with Faulty Solutions - Health Checks for Microservices to the Rescue**

**Abstract** In this presentation we'll discuss what is a health check, why are they crucial when handling multiple docker containers of a service and how to use them with the new Docker Engine v1.13 using Docker Swarm. We'll use as an example a faulty solution with and without health checks and see the benefits they provide.

**Pitch** The presentation is intended as an introduction to using health-checks as part of containers, in contrast with externally operated health-checks. The talk is focused with the primary objective to build more resilient self-healing systems that can do deploys with zero-downtime even with faulty components that fail partially. The presentation contains live-coding and demo.
